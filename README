This is project 1.
Questions: 
	what are our canditade numbers?
	is the formular for alpha correct?
	should we really use the discriminant \Delta for seeing that there is only one real root for alpah?
		this is a lot of work
	are the calculations in our protocol enought, or do we need more?

Bugs: 
	in improved steepest decent: after a few iterations alpha gets to small, and there are no more changes in the residual

In the report : 
       We have to change, in the question 4, we have to talk about u^TCu and u^THu, it is important to write transpose. 8but it changes absolutely nothing in the proof)
       The 3 plots here are for the answer at the question e. On the plot with two alphas, the green is the optimal. That is a part af the answer of g.
